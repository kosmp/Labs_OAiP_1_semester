First, the program removes the four letters C, Q, W and X. Instead of c, before the letters e, i, y, you will need to write the letter s, and in other cases, the letter k.
Instead of the letter q, you will need to write the letter k, instead of the combination qu - kv, instead of x - ks, and instead of w - v.
Secondly, the combination of letters ph will be written as f, youand oo - as u, ee - as i, th - as z.
In addition, all double consonants (including those formed after substitutions) will become single.
If the first letter of the letter combination to be replaced was uppercase, then the first letter of the replacement must also be uppercase.
The first letter in the replacements x --> ks, qu --> kv must always be lowercase.
